This is Plof Core, the standard library for Plof. It requires a compliant Plof
compiler and interpreter, such as cplof. It expects that the compiler supports
PSL and Plof files, and the following flags:

-N: Do not automatically include any code before the specified sources
-c: Compile only, do not interpret
-o: Output filename for -c
--debug: Include debug code

It also expects a PSL assembler, such as pslasm, which is a part of cplof.
