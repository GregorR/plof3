This is cplof, the C implementation of Plof. It requires the Boehm garbage
collector and PCRE. libffi is highly-recommended as well. cplof is a fairly
standard threaded bytecode interpreter, including a simple memoized recursive
descent (packrat) parser and PSL interpreter. It does not have JIT, inline
caching, or any other fancy features.

The file DEBUG details some compiler flags for producing debugging versions of
cplof. These flags should not be useful for most users.
