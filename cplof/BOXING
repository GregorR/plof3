There are three methods of boxing (or not boxing) ints in PSL

-DPLOF_BOX_INTS
        Fully boxed, ints go in raw data.

-DPLOF_INTS_IN_OBJECTS
        Objects contain ints directly, not in raw data, but ints are still objects.

Default
        Use ints instead of objects (not really spec-compliant per se).
