There are three methods of boxing (or not boxing) ints in PSL

-DPLOF_BOX_NUMBERS
        Fully boxed, ints go in raw data.

-DPLOF_INTS_IN_OBJECTS
        Objects contain ints directly, not in raw data, but ints are still
        objects.

-DPLOF_FREE_INTS (default)
        Use ints instead of objects. This is optimal and spec-compliant, but
        has the disadvantage of providing ints that are one bit shorter than in
        either of the other methods.
