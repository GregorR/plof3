There are certain debug flags you can set while compiling:

-DDEBUG_TIMING
    Debugs timing of operations.

-DDEBUG_NAMES
    Attempts to keep procedure/object names around for debugging using
    e.g. DEBUG_TIMING_PROCEDURE

-DDEBUG_TIMING_PROCEDURE
    Debugs timing of procedures.

-DDEBUG_INSTRUCTION_SEQUENCE
    Implements dinstruction_sequence_start and dinstruction_sequence_end
    instructions, which cause the interpreter to dump out the instruction
    sequence for a section.
