There are three methods of boxing (or not boxing) ints in PSL

-DPLOF_BOX_NUMBERS
        Fully boxed, ints go in raw data.

-DPLOF_INTS_IN_OBJECTS (default)
        Objects contain ints directly, not in raw data, but ints are still objects.

-DPLOF_FREE_INTS
        Use ints instead of objects (not really spec-compliant per se, but the
        spec will be adjusted to match this by removing all guarantees on ints).
